CFFI-ft
=======

Foreign Function Interface for Python calling C code.

## Why a fork?

This is a fork of the CFFI project that adds support for free-threaded Python.
Our intention is to upstream the changes in our fork but we are publishing this
version to enable widespread real-world testing.

### How to depend on CFFI-ft

If your project depends on CFFI and you would like to publish free-threaded
wheels or experiment with the free-threaded build, you can add a dependency on
the `cffi-ft` on Python 3.13 and newer. For example, in a `pyproject.toml` file:

```toml
dependencies = [
    ...,
    "cffi; python_version<'3.13'",
    "cfft-ft; python_version>='3.13'",
]
```

Or in a `requirements.txt` file:

```
...
cffi python_version < '3.13'"
cfft-ft; python_version > ='3.13'
...
```

### Different module name

CFFI-ft uses a different module name (`cffi_ft`) than upstream CFFI on purpose:
so that both can be installed in the same environment.

To most easily use either library depending on which is available, you can
import `cffi` like this:

```
try:
    import cffi_ft as cffi
except ImportError:
    import cffi
```

This will import `cffi_ft` if it's available and use upstream CFFI otherwise.

### Different setuptools `setup` keyword

You will also need to adjust the `cffi_modules` keyword in the call to the
`setup` function in your `setup.py` script. To avoid ambiguity in situations
where both `cffi` and `cffi-ft` are installed, `cffi-ft` uses a `setup` keyword
named `cffi_ft_modules`. You can provide both in your `setup` call. It might
look something like this:

```python
setup(
    ...
    cffi_modules=["src/my_module/_ffi_build.py:ffi"],
    cffi_ft_modules=["src/my_module/_ffi_build.py:ffi"],
    ...
)
```

Testing/development tips
------------------------

After `git clone` or `wget && tar`, we will get a directory called `cffi` or `cffi-x.x.x`. we call it `repo-directory`. To run tests under CPython, run the following in the `repo-directory`:

    pip install pytest
    pip install -e .  # editable install of CFFI for local development
    pytest src/c/ testing/
